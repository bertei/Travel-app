## Travel App Project
### This project is based in [rossxross DevOps Bootcamp 2023, travel-app challenge](https://github.com/roxsross/bootcamp-devops-2023/tree/clase2-linux-bash/app-295devops-travel).
First, I set up a [LAMP Stack for the travel-app challenge](https://github.com/bertei/LAMP-Project) via AWS (EC2). This time around, I'm dockerizing the app and setting it up with ECS + RDS.
